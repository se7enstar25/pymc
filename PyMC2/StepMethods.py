# Changeset history
# 22/03/2007 -DH- Added a _state attribute containing the name of the attributes that make up the state of the step method, and a method to return that state in a dict. Added an id.
# TODO: Make the competences attributes of the step methods, the code will be cleaner.
# TODO: Test cases for binary and discrete Metropolises.

    Applies the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to several stochs

    with mean zero and covariance equal to the empirical covariance
    of the stochs, times _asf ** 2.

    - variables (optional) : list or array
            A sequence of pymc objects to handle using

    - stoch (optional) : Stochastic
            Alternatively to variables, a single stoch can be passed.
    
    - epoch (optional) : integer
            After epoch values are stored in the internal
            traces, the covariance is recomputed.

            starting to record values for computing the joint
            covariance.
    
    - dist (optional) : string
            The proposal distribution. May be 'Normal', 'RoundedNormal', 'Bernoulli',
            'Prior' or None. If None is provided, a proposal distribution is
            chosen by examining P.value's type.
    
    - scale (optional) : float
            Scale stoch.

            Dictionary of scales for one-at-a-time iterations.

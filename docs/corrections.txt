General Comments
----------------

The guide is well written and concise. The writing style is relaxed, which makes reading the guide a pleasant experience compared to R's terse and formal documents. I think the
document describes in enough details the general working of pymc, though some users would probably be thankful for more examples. Since the intended audience probably goes from python novices to experts and MCMC newbies to gurus and all permutations, it is probably worthwhile to flesh out the introduction to provide more references and state the assumed competence of readers with respect to these topics. 

An abstract and a conclusion are missing. 
[AP] Do we really need an abstract and conclusion, even for JSS?
[DH] Maybe not an abstract, but some kind of conclusion (what's next, get involved, ...) would still be nice. 

Specific Comments
-----------------

 * Use the JSS style.
[DH] Clashes with the python style. see jss_article for comments. 
 * I had trouble latexing the file, specifically, I had to comment the includegraphics call for the poor_mixing figure (got endcsname errors), and bibtex complains about a missing cross-ref to Bernardo, altough it is there in the bib file. 
 * Harmonize class names typeface.

4-7   	The intro needs to be fleshed out, with more examples of usage and a description of the structure of the document. 
8 		The features are a bit ragtag. Try to put some uniformity in there, bullet point style.
28 		Not sure an example of usage should go in so early in the text. 
[AP] I like this bit here- I think it has a good chance of hooking window-shoppers with short attention spans.


160 	Should we put the node graph ? 
[AP] Tricky one. Ecologists seem to dislike node graphs for the most part, but some of the machine learning types that have been cropping up on the list would like them.
[CF] I just published one in Endangered Species Research, and they did not seem to mind. They are particularly useful for very complex models.
178		Wondering if it would be best to replace from pymc import ... by import pymc.
[AP] In the tutorial, I'd vote for from pymc import *.
[CF] from pymc import * is almost universally discouraged these days, because of namespace concerns. Dont want to encourage bad habits ...
273		Explain the new interface to the traces. 
[AP] Actually, you ought to update this with the new trace slicing conventions.
[DH] Will do.

827		Maybe say a few words about the fact that the parameters of the multivariate normal are estimated using derivatives at the maximum a posteriori values: variances are estimated using partial derivatives and correlation coefficients using mixed partial derivatives ( and this is why discrete variables can't be fitted). 
[AP] Sometimes they work if you use Nelder-Mead, but it gets kind of wishy-washy. 

925		How ?
927		More info. 
938		Provide more info about the method. 

1187	I get weird looking symbols here. 
[AP] me too.
1271	This section ... strange transition, and not really a section.

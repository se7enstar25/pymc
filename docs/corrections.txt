General Comments
----------------

The guide is well written and concise. The writing style is relaxed, which makes reading the guide a pleasant experience compared to R's terse and formal documents. I think the
document describes in enough details the general working of pymc, though some users would probably be thankful for more examples. Since the intended audience probably goes from python novices to experts and MCMC newbies to gurus and all permutations, it is probably worthwhile to flesh out the introduction to provide more references and state the assumed competence of readers with respect to these topics. 

An abstract and a conclusion are missing. 
[AP] Do we really need an abstract and conclusion, even for JSS?
[DH] Maybe not an abstract, but some kind of conclusion (what's next, get involved, ...) would still be nice. 

Specific Comments

 * I had trouble latexing the file, specifically, I had to comment the includegraphics call for the poor_mixing figure (got endcsname errors).
 * Harmonize class names typeface.

4-7   	The intro needs to be fleshed out, with more examples of usage and a description of the structure of the document. 
8 		The features are a bit ragtag. Try to put some uniformity in there, bullet point style.


178		Wondering if it would be best to replace from pymc import ... by import pymc.
[AP] In the tutorial, I'd vote for from pymc import *.
[CF] from pymc import * is almost universally discouraged these days, because of namespace concerns. Dont want to encourage bad habits ...


1271	This section ... strange transition, and not really a section.

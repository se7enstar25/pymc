How to build PyMC3 docs
=======================

PyMC3 uses [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) which allows us to write documentation in markdown.

We also compile IPython notebooks (found in docs/notebooks) to markdown which then get picked up
by mkdocs.

To build the docs, run the `build_and_deploy_docs.sh` script.

Trunk stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The trunk/ should always be stable; meaning that it should pass the test
suite at all time. This means developers should always run pymc.test()
before committing their changes. If a change breaks something that was
not covered by the test suite, then it's a good idea to write a 
regression test to make sure that doesn't happen again. 

The setup.py file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The setup.py script describes how to build the software, and what is 
needed to build the software is also what is included in the source 
distribution. 

To include other files, such as documentation, specify the names or 
pattern in :file:`MANIFEST.in`. 

Before uploading a package to PyPi, make sure you have the correct version
number defined in setup.py. 



Creating source and binary distributions:

 * Source::
  
   python setup.py sdist

 * Windows::
  
   python setup.py bdist_wininst
 
 * POSIX::
 
   python setup.py bdist
 

To upload to PyPi::
  
   python setup.py sdist upload
   
   
To simply change the information about the package, as defined in setup.py::

   python setup.py register
   
   
To tag the 2.1.1 release::

   svn cp https://pymc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
    https://pymc.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2.1.1 \
    -m "Tagging the 2.1.1 release."
    
    
Conventions: 

 * alpha release (not everything is implemented): 2.1a
 
 * beta release (released for testing): 2.1b
 
 * release candidate 1(mostly finished): 2.1rc1
 
 * Major release (some API breaking allowed): 2.0
 
 * Minor release (no API breaks): 2.1
 
 * Bug fix release: 2.1.1

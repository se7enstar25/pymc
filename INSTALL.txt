PyMC is known to run on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows, but in theory should be 
able to work on just about any platform for which Python is available (and 
there are many). Before installing PyMC, you will need to install some 
dependencies. 


Dependencies
============

PyMC requires some prerequisite packages to be present on the system before the 
PyMC package itself is installed. Fortunately, there are currently only a few 
dependencies, and all are freely available online.

* `Python`_ version 2.4 or later. 


* `NumPy`_: The fundamental scientific programming package, it provides a 
  multidimensional array type and many useful functions for numerical analysis. 
  Use the latest version preferably. 

* `Matplotlib`_ (optional): A plotting package.

* `SciPy`_ (optional): A scientific package with a lot of functionality. 

* `IPython`_ (optional): A convenient python shell coming with parallel 
  computing facilities. 

There are prebuilt distributions that include all the needed dependencies. For 
Mac OS X and Linux users, we recommend the `ActiveState`_ distributions. 
Windows users should download and install `Enthought Python`_. The Mac OS X 
binary distribution of PyMC comes bundled with these prerequisites.

If instead of installing the prebuilt binaries you prefer (or have) to build PyMC 
yourself, make sure you have a Fortran and a C compiler. There are free
compilers (g77, gcc) available on all platforms. Other compilers have not been
tested with PyMC but may work nonetheless.

Platform-specific instructions
==============================

Windows
-------
1. Download the prebuilt binary installer from http://code.google.com/p/pymc/downloads/list
2. Simply double-click the executable installation package, and follow the on-screen instructions.

To build from source, get the source code tarball or checkout the subversion
repository, move into the resulting source directory in the command terminal 
and type::

    python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 install

This assumes you are using the GCC compiler (recommended). Otherwise, 
change the --compiler argument accordingly. 

Mac OS X
--------
1. Download the prebuilt binary installer from http://code.google.com/p/pymc/downloads/list
2. Double-click the installer package. Your archive utility will usually expand 
   the installer from its archive. From here, the prerequisite packages can be 
   installed (by double-clicking the installers and following the on-screen 
   instructions), followed by the PyMC package itself.

To build and install PyMC from source:

1. Download the source tarball or checkout the subversion repository.
2. Ensure that you are using GCC 3.3 (on newer OS X systems GCC 4.0.1 is the default)::

       sudo gcc_select 3.3

3. Untar the source archive, then move into the resulting source directory in
   the command terminal and type::

       python setup.py build
       sudo python setup.py install

The `sudo` command is required to install PyMC into the Python site-packages 
directory, which should have restricted privileges. You will be prompted for a 
password, and provided you have superuser privileges, the installation will 
proceed.

Linux
-----
Unfortunately, binary installers are not currently available for Linux systems, 
but it is straightforward to build the package yourself. 

1. Download the source tarball or checkout the subversion repository.
2. Untar the package archive, then move to the resulting archive directory and type::

       python setup.py build
       sudo python setup.py install


Subversion repository
=====================

You can check out the bleeding edge version of the code from the subversion 
repository::

    svn checkout http://pymc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pymc
  

Previous versions are available in the /tags/ directory. 


Running the test suite
======================

To make sure everything is working correctly, open a python shell and type::
  
    import pymc
    pymc.test()

You should see a lot of tests being run, and messages appear if errors are 
raised or if some tests fail. In case this happens (it shouldn't), please report
the problems on the issue tracker, specifying the version you are using and the
environment. Some of the tests require SciPy, if it is not installed on your 
system, you should not worry too much about failing tests. 


Bugs and feature requests
=========================

Report problems with the installation, bugs in the code or feature request at 
the issue tracker at http://code.google.com/p/pymc/issues/list .

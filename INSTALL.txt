``pymc`` is known to run on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows, but in theory should be 
able to work on just about any platform for which Python and the numpy module 
are  available. Before installing ``pymc``, you will need to install some dependencies. 


Dependencies
============

PyMC requires some prerequisite packages to be present on the system before the 
PyMC package itself is installed. Fortunately, there are currently only a few 
dependencies, and all are freely available online.

* `Python`_ version 2.5 or later. 

* `NumPy`_: The fundamental scientific programming package, it provides a 
  multidimensional array type and many useful functions for numerical analysis. 
  Use the latest version preferably. 

* `Matplotlib`_ (optional): A plotting package.

* `SciPy`_ (optional): A scientific package with a lot of functionality. 

* `IPython`_ (optional): A convenient python shell coming with parallel 
  computing facilities. 

* `pyTables`_ (optional): An interface to the HDF5 library for storing datasets
  in binary format.



There are prebuilt distributions that include all the needed dependencies. For 
Mac OSX users, we recommend the `MacPython`_ distribution, the 
`Enthought Python Distribution`_, or Python 2.5.1 that ships with 
OSX 10.5 (Leopard). Windows users should download and install the 
`Enthought Python Distribution`_. The Enthought Python Distribution comes 
bundled with these prerequisites.

If instead of installing the prebuilt binaries you prefer (or have) to build 
``pymc`` yourself, make sure you have a Fortran and a C compiler. There are free
compilers (gfortran, gcc) available on all platforms. Other compilers have not been
tested with PyMC but may work nonetheless.

Platform-specific instructions
==============================

Windows
-------
1. Download the prebuilt binary installer from 
2. Simply double-click the executable installation package, and follow the on-screen instructions.

To build from source, get the source code tarball or checkout the subversion
repository, move into the resulting source directory in the command terminal 
and type::

    python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 install

This assumes you are using the GCC compiler (recommended). Otherwise, 
change the --compiler argument accordingly. 

Mac OS X
--------
Mac binaries are installed using `EasyInstall`_, part of the setuptools suite. 
Once EasyInstall is on your system, simply type::

    sudo easy_install -Z -i http://drop.io/superpack pymc
    
The `sudo` command will be required to install PyMC into the Python site-packages 
directory if it has restricted privileges. You will be prompted for a  password, and 
provided you have superuser privileges, the installation will proceed.

To build and install PyMC from source:

1. Download the source tarball or checkout the subversion repository.
2. Untar the source archive, then move into the resulting source directory in
   the command terminal and type::

       python setup.py build
       sudo python setup.py install

Linux
-----
Unfortunately, binary installers are not currently available for Linux systems, 
but it is straightforward to build the package yourself. 

1. Download the source tarball or checkout the subversion repository.
2. Untar the package archive, then move to the resulting archive directory and type::

       python setup.py build
       python setup.py install

The `sudo` command will be required to install PyMC into the Python site-packages 
directory if it has restricted privileges::

       sudo python setup.py install

You will be prompted for a  password, and provided you have superuser privileges, 
the installation will proceed.

Subversion repository
=====================

You can check out the bleeding edge version of the code from the subversion 
repository::

    svn checkout http://pymc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pymc
  

Previous versions are available in the /tags/ directory. 


Running the test suite
======================

``pymc`` comes with a set of tests that verify that the critical components
of the code work as expected. To run these tests, users must have `nose`_
installed on their system. The tests are launched from a python shell::  

    import pymc
    pymc.test()

In case of failures, messages detailing the nature of these failures will 
appear. In case this happens (it shouldn't), please report
the problems on the `issue tracker`_, specifying the version you are using and the
environment. Some of the tests require SciPy, if it is not installed on your 
system, you should not worry too much about failing tests.

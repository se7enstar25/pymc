# 30-3-07 AP: Changed Sampler to Model.

"""
This demo compares three different models for the coal mining disasters data.
It doesn't use RJMCMC, it just integrates out the model stochastics by sampling
their values conditional on their parents. Nothing fancy, but it works OK.

The biggest problem is that the variance of the samples of the model likelihoods
can be pretty big, so it takes a lot of samples to get a good estimate of the
model posterior probabilities. This'll probably be worse for more complicated
models. Maybe there's a literature on this problem.

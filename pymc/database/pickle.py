"""
The object passed as db to Sampler may be:
1. A string (the database module name),
2. A Database instance,

There could be two ways to initialize a Database instance:
1. Instantiation: db = PyMC.database.pickle.Database(**kwds)
2. Loading : db = PyMC.database.pickle.load(file)

Supporting 2 is a bit tricky, since it implies that we must :
a) restore the state of the database, using previously computed values,
b) restore the state of the Sampler.
which means that the database must also store the Sampler's state.
This is partially achieved.

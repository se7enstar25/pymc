\Abstract{
  This article introduces a package adding Gaussian process functionality to the Bayesian analysis package \pkg{PyMC}. Gaussian processes (GPs) are probability distributions for functions. In Bayesian statistics, they are often used as priors for functions whose forms are unknown. They can encode many types of knowledge about functions, yet remain much less restrictive than priors based on particular functional forms. GPs are not hard to understand at a conceptual level, but implementing them efficiently on a computer can require fairly involved linear algebra. This package implements Gaussian processes as a set of \proglang{Python} classes that can support many types of usage, from intuitive exploration to embedding them in larger probability models and fitting with MCMC.

\section{Conclusion}

This package is built around the \code{Realization} object, which represents random mathematical functions as random \proglang{Python} functions. This is arguably the most natural and intuitive representation possible within the \proglang{Python} programming language, which itself is widely regarded as unusually human-friendly.

This package inherits the flexibility of PyMC, described in section \ref{sec:gp-sub}, in that the descendants of a Gaussian process can depend on it via any Python function. Because \pkg{PyMC} allows any \proglang{Python} function to be used to transform variables in probability models, \proglang{Python} (like all modern programming languages) allows functions to be passed to other functions as arguments, and \code{GP} objects are function-valued random variables, this package supports construction of an enormous variety of probability models that involve scalar-valued Gaussian processes. The Duffy negativity example in section \ref{sub:geostat} exhibits a probability model whose nonstandard likelihood function involves transformations of two Gaussian processes. In keeping with the extensible spirit of PyMC, the package accomodates user-specified covariance functions, and provides support for automatic combination of covariance functions and distance metrics.

Strenuous efforts at optimization have resulted in good performance for `standard' Gaussian process-based analyses such as Bayesian geostatistics. For example, \cite{map} recently used it to conduct a fully Bayesian MCMC analysis involving a very expensive covariance function evaluated at 4,291 input locations. The library of covariance functions provided by the package is implemented in Fortran, and can take advantage of SMP systems. The linear algebra functionality is provided by \code{NumPy}, which can be configured to make use of optimized, multithreaded BLAS and LAPACK \textbf{cite} implementations. 

However, there are use cases for which this package's flexible object model prevents it from achieving performance on par with hand-optimized algorithms. For example, the \code{mesh} attribute of \texttt{GPSubmodel} objects is fixed on creation, but in many reversible-jump MCMC applications (e.g. \cite{gramacy} and the toy example above) the set of input locations under consideration changes as the MCMC progresses. It would be possible to fit these models using \texttt{GPSubmodel}, but the acceptance rate would typically be much lower than that enjoyed by a true reversible-jump MCMC algorithm. It remains to be seen whether this and related performance problems can be overcome without either diluting the conceptual fidelity of the object model or incurring an unacceptable level of program complexity.

More tutorial material, as well as documentation of a few additional features and the incomplete Cholesky decomposition algorithms, can be found in the \href{http://pymc.googlecode.com/files/GPUserGuide.pdf}{package documentation}.

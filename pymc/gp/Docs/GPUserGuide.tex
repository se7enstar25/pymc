% \section{Prerequisites}\label{sec:prerequisites}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Familiarity with \citetitle[www.python.org]{Python}. Several online tutorials can be found by clicking around the Python website, including \citetitle[www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/]{How to think like a computer scientist: Learning with Python} by Downey, Elkner and Meyers. More experienced programmers may prefer \citetitle[docs.python.org/tut/]{another tutorial} by Python's author. Python is generally regarded as having unusually good documentation for open-source software, and it is also considered one of the easiest general-purpose programming languages to learn.
%     \item Familiarity with Numerical Python, or \citetitle[www.scipy.org/numpy]{NumPy}. This package provides array and matrix objects and associated functions that are much faster than their equivalents in pure Python, and also more convenient for scientific and numerical work. If you're familiar with a matrix language such as Matlab or R, learning numpy shouldn't be too difficult. However, there are a few differences that can function as `gotchas' early on. Although numpy itself is available free of charge, its documentation costs \$40 and is available from \citetitle[www.scipy.org/Documentation]{the Scientific Python website}.
%     \item A conceptual understanding of Bayesian statistics. Some familiarity with the normal distribution would help. Gelman et al. \cite{gelman} and Berry \cite{berry} are good general references, as is \citetitle[http://www.ams.ucsc.edu/~draper/draper-BHM-2005.pdf]{Draper's book}. For a colorful online tutorial on the logical aspects of Bayesian statistics, see \citetitle[http://www.yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html]{An Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning}.

\chapter{The basics}\label{cha:basics}
Gaussian processes (GPs) are probability distributions for functions. In Bayesian statistics, they are often used as priors for functions whose forms are unknown because they can encode many types of knowledge about functions, yet remain much less restrictive than priors based on particular functional forms. GPs are not hard to understand at a conceptual level, but implementing them efficiently on a computer can require fairly involved linear algebra.

This package implements Gaussian processes as a set of Python classes that can support many types of usage, from intuitive exploration to embedding in larger probability models and fitting with MCMC.

All the code in the tutorial is in the folder \file{pymc/examples/gp} in the PyMC source tree.

\chapter{Incorporating Gaussian processes in PyMC probability models}\label{cha:PyMC}
This chapter will show you how to build and fit statistical models that go beyond simple nonparametric regression.
\include{tutorial2} 

\chapter{Extending the covariance functions: Writing your own, using alternate coordinate systems, building in anisotropy and nonstationarity}\label{cha:usercov}
This section will give you a brief tour of the \module{cov_funs} module and point out plugs where you can add functionality that isn't included in this package.
\include{extending}

\chapter{Overview of algorithms} \label{cha:numerics} 
More detail on these algorithms, as well as the internal workings of the mean, covariance and realization objects and the observe function, are given in the algorithm documentation.

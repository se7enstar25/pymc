    All linear algebra done with dense BLAS, so attempts to invert/ factorize 
    numerically singular covariance matrices will cause errors. On the other 
    hand, computations will be faster than with Covariance for full-rank 
    covariance matrices.

            (n,n_dim), where n is any integer and n_dim is the dimensionality of the space, or
            shape (n). In the latter case n_dim should be assumed to be 1.
                    
        -   `params`: Parameters to be passed to eval_fun.

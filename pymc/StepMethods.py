    (Haario et al., 2001) for details.

      - delay : int
          Number of steps before the empirical covariance is computed. If greedy

          the covariance.
        
      - scales : dict
          Dictionary containing the scale for each stochastic keyed by name.
          If cov is None, those scales are used to define an initial covariance

    weight(models, iter, priors = None)

    models is a list of models, iter is the number of samples to use, and
    priors is a dictionary of prior weights keyed by model.

    Example:

    M1 = Model(model_1)
    M2 = Model(model_2)
    weight(models = [M1,M2], iter = 100000, priors = {M1: .8, M2: .2})

    Returns a dictionary keyed by model of the model posterior probabilities.

    Need to attach an MCSE value to the return values!

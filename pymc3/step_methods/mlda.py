class MLDA(ArrayStepShared):
    """
    Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance (MLDA) sampling step that uses coarse
    approximations of a fine model to construct proposals in multiple levels.

    MLDA creates a hierarchy of MCMC chains. Chains sample from different
    posteriors that ideally should be approximations of the fine (top-level)
    posterior and require less computational effort to evaluate their likelihood.

    Each chain runs for a fixed number of iterations (subsampling_rate) and then
    the last sample generated is used as a proposal for the chain in the level
    above. The bottom-level chain is a MetropolisMLDA sampler. The algorithm achieves
    much higher acceptance rate and effective sample sizes than other samplers
    if the coarse models are sufficiently good approximations of the fine one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coarse_models : list
        List of coarse (multi-level) models, where the first model
        is the coarsest one (level=0) and the last model is the
        second finest one (level=L-1 where L is the number of levels).
        Note this list excludes the model passed to the model
        argument above, which is the finest available.
    vars : list
        List of variables for sampler
    base_S : standard deviation of base proposal covariance matrix
        Some measure of variance to parameterize base proposal distribution
    base_proposal_dist : function
        Function that returns zero-mean deviates when parameterized with
        S (and n). Defaults to normal. This is the proposal used in the
        coarsest (base) chain, i.e. level=0.
    base_scaling : scalar or array
        Initial scale factor for base proposal. Defaults to 1.
    tune : bool
        Flag for tuning for the base proposal. Defaults to True. Note that
        this is overidden by the tune parameter in sample(), i.e. when calling
        step=MLDA(tune=False, ...) and then sample(step=step, tune=200, ...),
        tuning will be activated for the first 200 steps.
    base_tune_interval : int
        The frequency of tuning for the base proposal. Defaults to 100
        iterations.
    model : PyMC Model
        Optional model for sampling step. Defaults to None
        (taken from context). This model should be the finest of all
        multilevel models.
    mode :  string or `Mode` instance.
        Compilation mode passed to Theano functions
    subsampling_rates : integer or list of integers
        One interger for all levels or a list with one number for each level
        (excluding the finest level).
        This is the number of samples generated in level l-1 to propose a sample
        for level l for all l levels (excluding the finest level). The length of
        the list needs to be the same as the length of coarse_models.
    base_blocked : bool
        To flag to choose whether base sampler (level=0) is a
        Compound MetropolisMLDA step (base_blocked=False)
        or a blocked MetropolisMLDA step (base_blocked=True).
